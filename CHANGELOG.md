Lots of fixes and visual polish, closer to T3 Code.

### Remote machines

- **Add machine**: a server icon at the end of the sidebar footer's Settings row, in Lists and Inbox.
- **Connect**: a rebuilt machine offers Connect, which pairs it again under the same name. A failed pairing stays listed and says why.
- A machine header's `+` and New space there make the space on that machine, this computer included.
- Inbox cards from another machine carry a server mark that names the machine on hover, as T3 does.
- The New menu marks remote spaces, and New space asks which machine.
- A space's icon is found on its own machine.

### Visual

- Spaces show their repo's favicon, else a monogram in one of T3's 18 colors on a light wash of it, instead of a white initial on a solid tile. A CJK name shows its first character.
- Inbox titles are bright when the agent needs you, is done or is in view, and dim otherwise.
- A card's program icon and machine mark end its third line, so the title keeps its own.
- Settled rows lead with their project's mark.
- Hovered buttons brighten their icon along with their text.
- Pane buttons no longer shift the pane header.

### Interaction

- Every icon and control shows a T3-style hover label with its key and a hint, opening upward near the window's bottom.
- Hovering an Inbox row fades its details in beside it and cross-fades its time with its button.
- Inbox rows slide to their new place, new ones fade in and gone ones fade out; a drop slides from where you let go.
- Settle and Unpin leave an undo notice for 5 seconds.
- The New menu works as T3's palette: spaces only, the list follows the highlight, New space and key hints in a footer.
- Menus, dialogs and drags behave alike: arrow keys in every menu, Clear asks through Herdr's confirm dialog, a dragged tab fades, and a drag ends when the pointer leaves.

### Fixes

- The space order and `ctrl-N` follow the nested rows, so worktrees under their checkout keep in step with the keys (from Herdr's own spaces mod).
- Clear no longer stays lit after its confirm dialog.
- pulls.review extra: no more Opening… popup.

### Removed

- The agent view. After updating, delete `"cmd-shift-a": "t3-tabs.view"` from `keys.json`.
